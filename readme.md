# Project
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string: 
```Ruby
> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

## Goal 
* Make sure the letters wrap the alphabet. e.g. Z shift 1 equals A.
* Accept large shift factors. e.g. Z shift 26,000,000 equals Z or Z shift 26,000,001 equals A.

I am now learing front end development and one of my very first projects is to get some of my simpler apps up and running with Sinatra. I came back to this and have got it working with Sinatra and deployed on Heroku. Check it out!
